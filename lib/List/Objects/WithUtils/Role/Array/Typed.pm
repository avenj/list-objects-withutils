=head1 NAME

List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array::Typed - Type-checking array behavior

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Via List::Objects::WithUtils::Array::Typed ->
  use List::Objects::WithUtils 'array_of';
  use Types::Standard -all;
  use List::Objects::Types -all;

  # Array of Ints:
  my $arr = array_of Int() => (1,2,3);

  # Array of array objects of Ints (coerced from ARRAYs):
  my $arr = array_of TypedArray[Int] => [1,2,3], [4,5,6];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role makes use of L<Type::Tie> to add type-checking behavior to
L<List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array> consumers.

The first argument passed to the constructor should be a L<Type::Tiny> type:

  use Types::Standard -all;
  my $arr = array_of Str() => qw/foo bar baz/;

Elements are checked against the specified type when the object is constructed
or new elements are added.

If the initial type-check fails, a coercion is attempted.

Values that cannot be coerced will throw an exception.

Also see L<Types::Standard>, L<List::Objects::Types>

=head2 type

Returns the L<Type::Tiny> type the object was created with.

=head2 untyped

Returns a (shallow) clone that is a plain L<List::Objects::WithUtils::Array>.

Since most methods that return a new list will (attempt to) return a list
object of the same type as their parent, this can be useful to avoid type
check failures in a method chain that creates intermediate lists.
