Slowdowns due to losing MoreUtils:

  uniq      (not so bad, mitigated currently)
  indexes   (bad, mitigated currently)
  natatime  (not so bad)
  tuples    (already sucked)

lower-priority?
  last_where / firstidx / lastidx
  items_after / items_after_incl / items_before / items_before_incl
  intersection
  Array->diff & Hash->diff
